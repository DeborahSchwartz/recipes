Guacamole
(you can easily make more than one serving by adding more stuff)

1  avocado
1 minced garlic clove
1/8 c chopped red onion
1/2 c chopped tomato
1/4 cchopped cilantro
1 T fresh lime juice
salt to taste

Mash the insides of an avocado with a fork. Add the garlic and other stuff and mix. Enjoy on tortilla chips, a burrito, or even a bagel. Just don't eat too much - this stuff is high in fat!
